Image overlays

Place PNG images here to be used as explanatory/sticker overlays for highlights. Filenames (without extension)
can be used as labels, e.g. `funny.png` for the "funny" label.

Recommendations:
- Use transparent backgrounds (PNG)
- Keep images small (e.g., 400x400) and centered for best results
